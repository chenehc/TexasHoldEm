	\section{Project Drivers}
	\subsection{The purpose of the Project}
	The purpose of the project is to design and develop a Texas Hold-Em game that a person 		can play for enjoyment and improvement of their skills by getting the user acquainted 		with the rules of the game through gameplay, and by facing a challenging computer 			opponent. There are too many people who do not know the basics of the game and the goal 	is to help those who need a way to learn the game before entering their first 				professional Texas Hold'em game, for example at a casino.
